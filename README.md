# CAPM - Capital Asset Pricing Model

This model outlines the connection between the anticipated return and the risk associated with securities. This model suggests that the expected return on a particular security can be calculated by adding the risk premium to the risk-free return. In other words, the expected return is determined by factoring in both the baseline return without risk (risk-free return) and the additional return demanded by investors to compensate for the inherent risk of the security (risk premium).

### R<Sub>i</Sub> = R<Sub>f</Sub> + B<Sub>i</Sub> (R<Sub>m</Sub> - R<Sub>f</Sub>)

R<Sub>i</Sub> = Expected Return on a Security

R<Sub>f</Sub> = Risk Free Rate of Return 

B<Sub>i</Sub> = Beta between the Stock & the Market

R<Sub>m</Sub> = Expected Return of the Market

CAPM assumes that there exists a risk free asset return with zero standard deviation

### Terms in the Project:

**Risk Free Asset Return** 
- A risk free asset could be a US Government 10 year Treasury bill. 
- Investors who are extremely risk averse would prefer to buy the risk free asset to protect their money and earn a low return. 
- If investors are interested in gaining more return, they have to bear more risk compared to the risk free asset 

**Market Portfolio Return**
- Market portfolio includes all securities in the market.
- A good representation of the market portfolio is the S&P 500. 
- Market portfolio return is the average return of the overall return of the SP500. 

**Beta**
- It is a measure of a stock's risk (volatility of returns) reflected by measuring the fluctuation of its price changes relative to the overall market. 
   - beta = 0: No Market Sensitivity 
   - beta <1: Low Market Sensitivity 
   - beta = 1: Same as Market (Neutral) 
   - beta >1: High Market Sensitivity
   - beta < 0: Negative Market Sensitivity
